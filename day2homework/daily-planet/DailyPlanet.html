            <h3 class="pg-headline">Grim crisis within EU borders</h3>
            <article>
                <p>Seventy-one decomposing bodies discovered in a truck on the side of an Austrian highway. Two hundred presumed drowned when their boat sunk off the Libyan coast. Fifty-two people found suffocated in the hold of another boat. This relentless catalog of death, within the space of 24 hours, is just the latest in a series of grim reminders of the crisis at and within EU borders.</p>
                <p>That people are dying to reach the EU is, depressingly, not news. This year alone, more than 2,300 people have died in the Mediterranean, according to the International Organisation for Migration. Deaths at sea capture much of the attention, but countless (literally: we don't know exactly how many) have died of suffocation, dehydration, and exposure to the elements at EU land borders. One count puts the overall death toll at EU borders at more than 30,000 since 2000.</p>
                <p>That people are dying to travel within the EU -- the truck was found near the border between Austria and Hungary, two EU countries -- has shocked many. It may be that these people were victims of human trafficking, coerced into the truck to be transported somewhere for the purposes of exploitation. But it may well be that they knowingly paid smugglers to take them from Hungary, where reports suggest that leg of the journey began, to another EU country. Either way, those responsible for this heinous crime -- four suspects have already been arrested -- should be held to account.</p>
                <p>But why would anyone put themselves in this kind of danger? According to U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, two-thirds of the over 300,000 people who have made the journey to the EU so far this year are from countries like Syria, Afghanistan, Eritrea, Somalia, and Iraq -- countries experiencing war or generalized violence, or under repressive regimes.</p>
                <p>Once in Greece or Italy, the two main entry points, many wish to continue onward to other EU countries. This is against EU rules, which impose the obligation on the first country of entry to process asylum claims. But it is often a rational choice for the asylum seekers themselves to head for countries where they believe prospects are better for receiving some kind of protection and proper integration measures.</p>
                <p>Despite harmonized asylum standards and procedures, EU members have strikingly varying asylum approval rates (about 10% in Hungary versus about 42% in Germany, for example). They also may want to join family members, or go where there is an established community from their country of origin, or where they believe they have a better shot at getting a job and giving their children a good education.</p>
                <p>Based on the information they have, many asylum seekers seek to reach Germany or Sweden, for example. It shouldn't surprise anyone that many of those who arrive in Greece, a debt-ridden country with a dysfunctional asylum system in no position to cope with the significant arrivals on its shores, plan to move onward.</p>
